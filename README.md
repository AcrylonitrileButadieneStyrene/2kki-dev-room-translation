# My 2kki Developer Room Translation
- Low quality and certainly incorrect.
- AI translation is forbidden.
- As few rights reserved as is possible.

I am using this to try to learn translating so non-code changes will likely not be upstreamed. Feel free to fork this repository and create your own version.

## Usage
Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AcrylonitrileButadieneStyrene/2kki-dev-room-translation/master/yno-2kki-dev-room-translation.user.js) to install the script for loading these translations on YNOproject.

The script is licensed under the same license as my other scripts: MIT + Apache 2.0

For an offline install, create a `Language` folder inside of the game and clone this repo into there.
